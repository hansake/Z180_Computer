Initially a very simple test program was made to run on the Z180 computer.

The program z80asm is used to assemble the code: [AlbertVeli/z80asm: Clone of z80asm (original is on Savannah)](https://github.com/AlbertVeli/z80asm)
Unfortunately the extra Z180 assembler mnemonics are not supported by this assembler, will switch assembler later.
