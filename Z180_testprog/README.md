Initially a very simple test program called blink180 was made to run on the Z180 computer.

The program test180 in its initial version tests MMU setup, RAM access and serial output.

The program z80asm is used to assemble the code: [AlbertVeli/z80asm: Clone of z80asm (original is on Savannah)](https://github.com/AlbertVeli/z80asm)
Unfortunately the extra Z180 assembler mnemonics are not supported by this assembler, will switch assembler later.
